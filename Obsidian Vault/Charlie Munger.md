Munger: "One advantage of buying cyclical businesses is a lot of people don’t like them. What difference does it make to us if earnings come in a lumpy fashion? In the big scheme of things, what do we care, as long as it’s a good business?"

The one thing about Berkshire is that we do get some opportunities that other people don’t get. If you’re 3G and want a partner for you’re next deal, who in the hell are you going to come to ? We know, they know we’re a good partner, so we see stuff other people don’t see.

- Charlie Munger

"I don’t think you can get to be a really good investor over a broad range without doing a massive amount of reading."

“In the real world, you uncover an opportunity, and then you compare other opportunities with that. And you only invest in the most attractive opportunities. That’s your opportunity cost.”

— Charlie Munger

“Generally, I think it’s quite smart to identify some investors you regard as very skilled, carefully examine everything they’re buying, and copy what you please.”

— Charlie Munger

"Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you."

— Charlie Munger

"Your outcome in life will be way more satisfactory and way better if you work under people you really admire."

— Charlie Munger

"I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself. Nobody is that smart."

“If something is too hard, we move on to something else. What could be simpler than that?”

- Charlie Munger

"The young man knows the rules, the old man knows the exceptions."

“Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much–loved hand.”

— Charlie Munger

"Get toxic people out of your life. Do it fast"

--- Charlie Munger

"I am personally skeptical of some of the hype going into artificial intelligence. I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well"

“I have made bad business decisions—you can’t live a successful life without doing some difficult things that go wrong. That’s just the nature of the game.”

— Charlie Munger

I think we have one other advantage:
A lot of other people are trying to be brilliant, and we're just trying to stay rational.
It's a big advantage—trying to be brilliant is dangerous...

Charlie Munger:
"There are 2 kinds of businesses: The 1st earns 12% & u can take it out at Yr1. 2nd earns 12%, but excess cash is reinvested; It reminds me of the guy who looks at all of his equipment & says, ‘There’s all of my profit.’ We hate that kind of business.”

- Charlie Munger

“I don’t think it would work well to have a half-and-half management.
We don’t need an operating guy; we have people running the businesses, and the main thing is not to destroy or damage the spirit they have.”

- Charlie Munger

I think the reason why we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle (ie. bait).

I asked him, "My God, they (the bait) are purple & green. Do fish really take these lures?"
And he said, "Mister, I don't sell to fish"

CM

If you invested Berkshire-style, it'd be hard to get paid as an investment manager as well as they're currently paid -
because you'd be holding a block of Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola and a block of something else.
You'd be sitting on your ass.
And the client would be getting rich.

CM

"In the corporate world, if you have analysts, due diligence, and no horse sense you’ve just described hell”

- Munger

"Discharge your duties faithfully. Step by step u get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts but u build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day if u live long enough most people get what they deserve” 

Munger

"If you have half as much sense as I think you do, you will immediately order copies for all of your children and several of your friends. You will never make a better investment.” 

Charlie Munger on @RobertCialdini & book Influence

"At most corporations if you make an acquisition and it turns out to be a disaster, all the paperwork and presentations that caused the dumb acquisition to be made are quickly forgotten. You’ve got denial, you’ve got everything in the world. You’ve got Pavlovian association tendency. Nobody even wants to even be associated with the damned thing or even mention it. At Johnson & Johnson, they make everybody revisit their old acquisitions and wade through the presentations. That is a very smart thing to do.”

- Charlie Munger

"Creative accounting is an absolute curse to a civilization" 

- Charlie Munger

Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand.

CM

"In a long life, you can expect to profit heavily from at least a few of those opportunities if you develop the wisdom and will to seize them. At any rate, "surfing" is a very powerful model." 

- Charlie Munger

“Why should it be easy to do something that, if done well, two or three times, will make your family rich for life?”

When you don't know and you don't have any special competence, don't be afraid to say so.

"Everyone can see that you have to more or less just guess at the useful life of a jet airplane or anything like that. Just because you express the depreciation rate in neat numbers doesn’t make it anything you really know.”

In effect, you've got to know what you know and what you don't know. What could possibly be more useful in life than that?

People adapt to a changing litigation climate. They have various various of doing it. That's how it's always been and how it's always going to be.

The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it’s going to kill you. And most people do not get this straight in their heads.

There are all kinds of wonderful new inventions that give you nothing except the opportunity to spend more money in a business that’s still lousy. The money still won’t come to you as all the advantages from great improvements are going to flow through to the customers

The whole concept of dividing it up into ‘value’ & ‘growth’ strikes me as twaddle. It’s convenient for a bunch of pension fund consultants to get fees prattling about & a way for one advisor to distinguish himself but, to me, all intelligent investing is value investing.

Warren spends 70 hours a week thinking about investing.

The ethos of not fooling yourself is one of the best you could possibly have. It’s powerful because it’s so rare.

I believe civilization needs a police force - although I don't believe in policemen creating too many widows and orphans unnecessarily either.

Well, if you're like me, it's kind of fun for it to be a little complicated.

If you want it totally easy and laid out, maybe you should join some cult that claims to provide all the answers.

Napoleon said he liked luckier generals - he wasn't into supporting losers.

Well, the Navy likes luckier captains.

If you're a Navy captain and up for 24 hours straight and have to go to sleep and you turn the ship over to a competent first mate in tough conditions and he takes the ship aground-clearly through no fault of yours - they don't court-martial you, but your naval career is over.

Just as a man working with his tools should know its limitations, a man working with his cognitive apparatus must know its limitations.

"Even bright people are going to have limited, really valuable insights in a very competitive world when they’re fighting against other very bright, hardworking people & it makes sense to load up on the very few good insights you have instead of  pretending to know everything about everything at all times”

"There are huge dangers with computers. People calculate too much and think too little”

"Much of what is taught in business school is twaddle. The Modern portfolio theory and the like"

"We think Diversification makes little sense for anyone who knows what they are doing. Its a protection against ignorance. If you know how to value businesses its crazy to own 50, or 40, or even 30 stocks. It strikes Charlie and I as madness"

What I personally hate most are systems that make fraud easy.

"GEICO to me is very much like Costco & one reason it’s succeeded is they really feel a holy duty to have a wonderful product at a very low price. A lot of people talk that game, but very few have it just right down under the body & soul of the company.
But GEICO does & companies like that tend to grind ahead over time... It’s easy to talk the game, but living the game is something else. I mean, it’s against the human nature of many entrepreneurial people to try and get the price down & service quality up all the time"

The human mind is not constructed so that it works well without having reasons. You've got to hang reality on a theoretical structure with reasons. That's the way it hangs together in usable form so that you're an effective thinker.

[Q: Do you find time to do fun things besides learning?]

I've always taken a fair amount of time to do what I really wanted to do - some of which was merely to fish or play bridge or play golf.
Each of us must figure out his or her own lifestyle.

I always knew that aiming low was the best path for me, and so I merely sought to learn from my betters a few practical mental tricks that would help me avoid some of the worst miscognitions common in my age cohort.

The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it’s going to kill you. And most people do not get this straight in their heads.

- CM

"Having flunked when we were young and strong at understanding some complex businesses, we’re not looking to master what we earlier failed at."

 - Munger 1997 AGM

The right place to find powerful elemental forces is in the subject matter of elementary academic courses.

"Most people get very few no-brainer opportunities, where it’s just so damned obvious... Since they are very few & may be separated by periods of years, people have to learn to have the courage & the intelligence to step up in a major way when those rare opportunities come by." 

- CM 
1997 AGM

"The name of the game is continuing to learn.
And even if you’re very well-trained and have some natural aptitude, you still need to keep learning."

-Munger 
1997 AGM

Even in our youth, some of the best professors were horrified by bad effects from balkanization of academia into insular, turf-protecting enclaves wherein notions were maintained by leaps of faith plus exclusion of nonbelievers.

"You must force yourself to consider opposing arguments. Especially when they challenge your best-loved ideas." 

— Charlie Munger

Munger: "Warren’s not willing to put capital out at less than 10% now. But if we knew interest rates would stay at 1%, we’d change."

"Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom."

"You can't live a successful life without doing some difficult things that go wrong. That's just the nature of the game, and you wouldn't be sufficiently courageous if you tried to avoid every single reverse." 

Charlie Munger

"A lot of brilliant people think they're way smarter than they are. And of course that's dangerous and causes trouble. I think great investors to some extent are like great chess players. They're almost born to be investors." 

Charlie Munger

"So many people are investing and the frenzy is so great and the reward systems are so foolish. I think the returns will go down. Nobody knows when bubbles are gonna blow up. We're in very uncharted waters. This has been unbelievable. There's never been anything quite like it."

"I regard my philanthropy as an absolute minimum duty for somebody who's reasonably successful to be reasonably generous. I don't think you get big merit points for philanthropy you do." 

Charlie Munger

Charlie has said many times that investing is harder now. He said that again today. When he started out there was lots more stupidity. If investing was as easy as following a formula there would be lots more billionaires who made their fortune investing than there are today.

One telling moment occurred today when Munger was asked what he was proudest of. I can't remember the exact words Charlie used since I was furiously typing then but I recall that he said he was proudest of being rational. That includes avoiding extreme dogma. Never stop learning.

Q: What are you proudest of? A: Avoiding things I don’t like, such as irrationality: I haven’t succeeded at eliminating it completely, no one does, but I’ve done better than I thought I would.

The truly exceptional opportunity only comes along a few times in a lifetime. When it does, the important thing, according to Charlie Munger, is to... 

"Use a shovel, not a teaspoon"

The culture and legal systems of the US are especially favorable to shareholder interests compared to other interests and compared to most other countries. Indeed, there are many other countries where any good going to public shareholders has a very low priority.

Charlie Munger on inversion:

"Avoid things like racing trains to a crossing, doing cocaine, [taking unnecessary Covid risks] etc. A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what to avoid like an early death.” 
“Figure out what you don’t want and avoid it."

Charlie Munger said this week: "What helps everyone is to get in something that's going up and it just carries you along without much talent or work. You've got a big tailwind."

https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2020/12/13/what-comes-after-smartphones

Munger also said this week: "Good investing requires a weird combination of patience and aggression, and not many people have it."

"Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of things." 

— Charlie Munger

Charlie Munger didn’t join Warren Buffett and Berkshire until he was 52 years old (in 1978).

They’ve made more money than anybody, and they have the best investment record of anybody.

Charlie Munger:
Munger on Teaching.. "We think it is such a high calling that we subject people to it all the time who don't have the slightest intention of ever learning anything from it. Very few people have taught with more rejection than we have & yet maintained as much enthusiasm."

“The world is full of foolish gamblers and they will not do as well as the patient investors.” 

Charlie Munger

In 1962 Charlie Munger set up Wheeler, Munger & Co generating an average annual return of +37.1% (before fees) from 1962 to 1969. The S&P 500 gained only 6.6% in the same period. His fund was in operation for 14 years and his returns were +24.2% p.a. At one point, near the end of 1974, Blue Chip Stamps made up 61% of the fund’s portfolio. When the worst bear market since 1929 hit, the company was crushed. Munger wrote, “As for the original business of Blue Chip Stamps: ‘I presided over a reduction in trading stamp sales from over $120mdown to less than $100,000. So I presided over a failure of 99.99 percent. Blue Chip Stamps would recover and go on to purchase See’s Candies, the Buffalo Evening News and Wesco Financial, and, after two years with losses of more than 30%, the fund recovered and returned 73.2% in 1975 and later, it was merged in Berkshire Hathaway.

“The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” 

— Charlie Munger

"We greatly admire See's business methods, which have not been changed in any significant way in the 7 years of our ownership. Our main managerial contribution has been to leave See's alone as its proven executives pursued its proven policies"

- Charlie Munger, 1978

"We believe that our 
(1) heavy emphasis on the cash-generation 
(2) reluctance to issue new stock & 
(3) strong balance sheet 
are all likely to enjoy increased recognition in future years as qualities to be emphasized by selectors of common stocks for investment"

- Munger 1980

"Inflation is a very effective form of indirect taxation on capital represented by holdings of common stock. We know of no adequate countermeasure, generally available to corporate managers who wish to protect shareholders, to this form of indirect tax"

- Charlie Munger 1980

"We began the 1980s with five constituent businesses. They are all high-grade operations, manned by high-grade people operating within a long tradition emphasizing reliable & effective service. Each business will generate substantial amounts of cash"

- Charlie Munger 1980

"One cause of our hope for a higher return is our recognition of how many mistakes we made in the course of earning 15% on equity in the decade just past. There is plenty of room for improved decision-making, and we intend to improve if we can"

"Precision Steel shares an extremely important quality with See's: a company-wide culture of constant concern for customer interests and fair dealing. We believe such quality will almost always produce good long-term business results"

In the United States, a person or institution with almost all wealth invested long-term, in just three fine domestic corporations, is securely rich. And why should such an owner care if, at any time, most other investors are faring somewhat better or worse?

"We recognize that the invention of graphs & color pictures improved communication, yet we continue in our own way because it seems adequate in our special case, is cheaper, & is less associated with financial PR practices we prefer not to emulate"

I have more than skepticism regarding the orthodox view that huge diversification is a must for those wise enough so that indexation is not the logical mode for equity investment. I think the orthodox view is grossly mistaken.

• Over the long-term, big companies of America behave more like biology than they do anything else. In biology, all the individuals die and so do all the species, it’s just a question of time." Refers to department stores, newspapers, US Steel, John D Rockefeller’s Standard Oil.

• We just try to avoid big change that’s likely to hurt us.

• Everybody uses new technology, but it really helps to have a position that almost can’t be taken away by technology.

• I try and keep it simple and fundamental as much as I can.

• I’m a very blocking and tackling kind of a thinker.

• The single most important thing, if you want to avoid a lot of stupid errors, is knowing where you’re competent and where you aren’t.

• I did not make my fortune by predicting macroeconomic changes better than other people. What Buffett and I did was we bought things that were promising. And then…sometimes we had a tailwind from the economy and sometimes we had a headwind. And either way we just kept swimming.

• You can’t live a successful life without doing some difficult things that go wrong. That’s just the nature of the game. And you wouldn’t be sufficiently courageous if you tried to avoid every single reverse.

• In investment decisions I think it’s very helpful to be able to yourself be pretty comfortable with the big ideas in all the disciplines.

• On traits of a great investor: 
- have to know a lot

- weird combination of patience & aggression 
- big amount of self awareness / knowing the edge of your own competency

In short, in the LBO field, there is a buried covariance with marketable equities - toward disaster in generally bad business conditions - and competition is now extreme.

Charlie Munger: "In the real world, you uncover an opportunity, and then you compare other opportunities with that. And you only invest in the most attractive opportunities. That’s your opportunity cost. That’s why Modern Portfolio Theory is so asenine."

2021 Predictions from Charlie Munger:

"Civilization has always had soothsayers, shamans, faith healers, and God knows what all. And that’s just the way it is, I’m afraid. It’s nice they keep an image of being constructive, sensible people when they’re really would-be faith healers. It keeps their self respect up." CM

"When it comes to adversity, you have just to soldier through. Being too frightened leads to contempt. Coping with adversity brings opportunities. Don’t panic or go crazy. People will always remember the person who could keep his or her cool"

The thing is, in the investment business, people think they can learn a million things and think they will excel in all those million things.
That's a joke. That's a delusion. 
Instead, the way to get ahead is to focus and bet big on few.
That's what I did.

- Charlie Munger

It doesn't help us merely for favorable odds to exist. They have to be in a place where we can recognize them. 
So, it takes a mispriced opportunity that we're smart enough to recognize. And that combination doesn't occur often. But it doesn't have to.

And, of course, 50% will end up in the bottom half, and 70% will end up in the bottom 70%.
But some people will have an advantage.

"The difference between being totally efficient and somewhat efficient leaves an enormous opportunity for people to get these unusual records. It’s efficient enough, so it’s hard to have a great investment record. But it’s by no means impossible."

Charlie Munger: 
“We have the same problem as everyone else: It's very hard to predict the future...” 

"It's highly likely that the people who confidently think they know the consequences – none of whom predicted this – now they know what’s going to happen next?"

If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, you may start out trying and soon find out that it's hopeless - that other people blow right by you.

However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-thirds of you.

Technology moves as fast ... you get a phenomenon chat I call competitive destruction.

You know, you have the finest buggy whip factory, and, all of a sudden, in comes this little horseless carriage.

And before too many years go by, your buggy whip business is dead.

The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it's going to kill you. 

And most people do not get this straight in their heads. 

But a fellow like Buffett does.

"Don't overspend. Even Mozart couldn't get away with doing that. He was utterly miserable most of the time because he overspent his income."

“There is no way you can live an adequate life without making many mistakes.”

“Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.”

Charlie on performance 

“Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance).”

You can say, "Is this a nice way to behave?"
Well, capitalism is a pretty brutal place.

"It’s very important not to let little corruptions start, because they become big corruptions. And then you have vested interest that fight to perpetuate them." 

- Munger 1999 AGM, on stock options accounting

"We made our money by being long some wonderful businesses. We didn’t make it by a long-short strategy"

"Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you."

Charlie on independence 

“Like Warren, I had a considerable passion to get rich, not because I wanted Ferraris – I wanted the independence. I desperately wanted it.”

"Averaged out, betting on the quality of business is better than betting on the quality of management"

The concept of a chain store was a fascinating invention.

You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.

“We all are learning, modifying, or destroying ideas all the time. Rapid destruction of your ideas when the time is right is one of the most valuable qualities you can acquire. You must force yourself to consider arguments on the other side.”

"Generally speaking, trying to dance in and out of the companies you really love, on a long-term basis, has not been a good idea for most investors. And we’re quite content to sit with our best holdings."

"The only duty of a corporate executive is to widen the moat. I can see instance after instance where that isn’t what people do in business. One must keep their eye on the ball of widening the moat, to be a steward of the competitive advantage that came to you."

Stocks are valued partly like bonds, based on roughly rational projections of producing future cash. But, they are also valued partly like Rembrandt paintings, purchased mostly because their prices have gone up so far.

Financial institutions tend to make us nervous when they’re trying to do well. That sounds paradoxical, but that’s the way it is.

Charlie on patience

“The big money is not in the buying the selling, but in the waiting.”

"The man who needs a new machine tool and hasn't bought it is already paying for it." 

(The Warner & Swasey Rule)

The ethical rule is from Samuel Johnson who believed that maintenance of easily removable ignorance by a responsible office holder was treacherous malfeasance in meeting moral obligation. The prudential rule is that underlying the old Warner & Swasey advertisement for machine tools: "The man who needs a new machine tool, and hasn't bought it, is already paying for it". The Warner & Swasey rule also applies, I believe, to thinking tools. If you don't have the right thinking tools, you, and the people you seek to help, are already suffering from your easily removable ignorance.

Charlie on checklists 
“No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use a checklist.”

Obviously, you have to know accounting. It's the language of practical business life. It was a very useful thing to deliver to civilization.

One of the advantages of a fellow like Buffet, whom I've worked with all these years, is that he automatically thinks in terms of decision trees and the elementary math of permutations and combinations.

Charlie on simplicity 
“We have a passion for keeping things simple.”

If you don't get elementary probability into your repertoire, you go through a long life like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.

You're giving a huge advantage to everybody else.

First there's mathematics. 

Obviously, you've got to be able to handle numbers and quantities - basic arithmetic. 

And the great useful model, after compound interest, is the elementary math of permutations and combinations.

"Faced with the choice between changing one's mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof." 

- John Kenneth Galbraith

Charlie on relationships
“How to find a good spouse? -the best single way is to deserve a good spouse.”

It's like the old saying, "To the man with only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail."
That's the way the chiropractor goes about practicing medicine.
But that's a perfectly disastrous way to think and operate in the world.
So you have got to have multiple models.

You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and fail in life. 
You've got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.

The very nature of things is that if you get a whole lot of volume through your operation, you get better at processing that volume.
That's an enormous advantage.
And it has a lot to do with which businesses succeed and fail.

One great advantage of scale taught in all of the business schools of the world is cost reductions along the so-called experience curve.
Just doing something complicated in more and more volume enables human beings ... to do it more and more efficiently.

It's hard to know what exact macroeconomic policy is correct because no one knows for sure just how much government intervention is wise and at what point the government should stop intervening. 
I don't think we have any great gift at making macroeconomic predictions.

- Munger

“It takes character to sit with all that cash and to do nothing.

In terms of which businesses succeed and which businesses fail, advantages of scale are ungodly important.

One approach is rationality - the way you'd work out a bridge problem: by evaluating the real interests, the real probabilities, and so forth. 

And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subconscious conclusions- many of which are wrong.

So you have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. 

If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. 

And that's as close to certain as any prediction that you can make.

✅ Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom. 

✅ Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutiae. 

✅ Face your big troubles; don't sweep them under the rug.

"I talked about patience. I read Barron’s for fifty years. In fifty years I found one investment opportunity in Barron’s. I made about $80 million, with almost no risk."

“We both (Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett) insist on a lot of time being available almost every day to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. We read and think.”

It's not given to human beings to have such talent that they can just know everything about everything all the time. But it is given to human beings who work hard at it - who look and sift the world for a mispriced bet - that they can occasionally find one.

"Maybe you should be extraordinarily careful if you’re a professional partnership, with what clients you take on and how far you go for them... It’s crazy, in the kind of world we inhabit, to operate in any other way." 

-Munger

"Getting the incentives right" for the decision maker is a very, very important lesson.

There are actually businesses that you will find a few times in a lifetime where any manager could raise the return enormously just by raising prices - and yet they haven't done it.

So they have huge untapped pricing power that they're not using.

That is the ultimate no-brainer

Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you.

"You’re asking for a lot if you want some simple way of not being taken in by the frauds of the world... Enormously talented people deliberately go into fraud, drift gradually into it because the culture carries them there, and the frauds get very sophisticated." 

- Munger

"The stock option is both an expense and a dilution, and both factors should be taken into account in proper accounting."

That contract bridge is so out of vogue in your generation is a tragedy. 
China is way smarter than we are about bridge. 
They're teaching bridge in grade school now. 
And God knows the Chinese do well enough when introduced to capitalist civilization.

WB: He’ll carry around Ben Franklin’s autobiography.

CM: The kind of people who defraud us are not going to be the kind of people who are defrauding everybody else.

"The ordinary result when a big publicly-held corporation buys another corporation is that, maybe two-thirds of the time, it’s a terrible deal for the buying corporation and yet the people have taken an enormous time doing it."

"And we’ve bought all these businesses taking practically no time in doing it, and on average they’ve worked out wonderfully. Why is that? That’s a good question. The answer is we wait for the no-brainers. We’re not trying to do the difficult things."

-CM

Charlie Munger:
"I knew from being a poker player you have to bet heavily when you've got huge odds in your favor.
I knew I could handle the bumps psychologically because I was raised by people who believe in handling bumps.
So I was an ideal person to adopt my own methodology."

"It’s amazing the amount of speculation we have. We have computers with algorithms trading against other computers. We have people who know nothing about stocks being advised by stock brokers who know even less – but they understand the commission though!" 

- Charlie Munger

"I think this kind of crazy speculation and enterprises not even found or picked out yet is just a sign of an irritating bubble. It’s just the investment banking profession will sell s--- as long as s--- can be sold"

- Charlie Munger

"The human greed and the aggression of the brokerage community creates these bubbles from time to time. I think wise people just stay out of them"

- Charlie Munger

"How many people can wait 5 years & do nothing, not many .. the big money is not in the buying/selling but waiting"

Think of the pretentious expenditures of the rich.
Who in the hell needs a Rolex watch so you can get mugged for it?
Yet, everybody wants to have a pretentious expenditure.
That helps drive demand in our modern capitalist society.
My advice to the young people is: don’t go there.
I don’t think there’s much happiness in it. But it does drive the civilization we actually have. And it drives the dissatisfaction.

"There isn’t a single formula. You need to know a lot about business and human nature and the numbers. It is unreasonable to expect that there is a magic system that will do it for you"

"A 16% ROE won't do much in real terms for shareholders if the inflation rate is 16%, or even 11% when we also allow for income taxes imposed on owners who must report taxable profits. We remind shareholders of this truism.

"Many businesses, once good investments when inflation was low are now under inflationary conditions, unable to produce much if any cash even when physical volume is constant. Any such business always cash-starved is not to become a new subsidiary of ours"

If you take all the acquisitions that CBS made under Paley after the acquisition of the network itself, with all his dumb advisors - his investment bankers, management consultants, and so forth, who were getting paid very handsomely - it was absolutely terrible.

-Charlie Munger

Television was dominated by CBS in its early days. Paley was a god.
     But he didn't like to hear what he didn't like to hear, & people soon learned that. So they told Paley only what he liked to hear.
     He was soon living in a little cocoon of unreality & everything else was corrupt.

CBS provides an interesting example of another rule of psychology - namely, Pavlovian association. If people tell you what you really don't want to hear - what's unpleasant - there's an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it.

Obviously, you have to know accounting.

It's the language of practical business life.

It was a very useful thing to deliver to civilization.

Blockchain is a new good thing come up, like fairy dust."

"#Crypto is an investment in nothing"

--- Charlie Munger

Munger in 1997: 
"Another filter that Warren has is this concept of the 'quality person.' Of course, most people define 'quality person' as somebody very much like themselves. But there’s so many wonderful people out there. And there’s so many awful people out there.
There’s signs frequently, like flags, particularly over the awful people. Generally speaking, those people are to be avoided. The amount of misery you bring into your life by trusting an awful person and the amount of felicity you can bring in by making the right associations.
There’s some wonderful people who have created wonderful businesses. Their customers can trust them. The employees can trust them. Those are the kind of people you want. People who take their promises seriously.
People who think like that frequently do very well in business. And the flags are flying."

Buffet: 
"It’s like they got a sign on their chest that just says, 'Jerk. Jerk. Jerk.' And then you think you’re going to buy the business and they aren’t going to be a jerk anymore."

Munger:

"Isaac Newton lost an enormous chunk of his net worth in the South Sea Bubble. He invested in an absolute crooked mania. Here was the smartest man in the world. Just IQ points alone won’t do it."

“Our ideas are so simple that people keep asking us for mysteries when all we have are the most elementary ideas.”

— Charlie Munger

Charlie Munger: "Once you get wrongdoers rich, they get enormous political power to prevent change in the laws that are enriching them. It means that we should all be more vigilant about stepping on these wrongs when they’re small. When they get large, they’re very hard to stop."

"I think if you expect total rationality either in humans or human institutions, you're expecting what's not going to happen."

— Charlie Munger

— Charlie Munger

“Microeconomics is what we do and macroeconomics is what we put up with.”

— Charlie Munger

Munger:

"The quality of accounting in America for derivative transactions is still terrible. It’s too optimistic. When you talk about guaranteeing future credits way, way out, that lends itself to people getting very optimistic in their assumptions and in their audited figures."

"And people pay attention to the audited figures, not the underlying reality. So therefore, if the accounting is lousy, the business decisions are lousy. And I think that’s going on mightily as we sit here."

It is possible for a tortoise, content to assimilate proven insights of his best predecessors, to outrun hares that seek originality. This happens as the tortoise stumbles on some particularly effective way to apply the best previous work, or simply avoids standard calamities.

"I think the new troubles are likely to be different from the old troubles. You may wish you had a Volcker-style recession instead of what you’re gonna get. The troubles that come to us could be worse than what Volcker was dealing with. And harder to fix"

"Accounting is the language of practical business life. You have to know enough about it to understand its limitations - because although accounting is the starting place, it’s only a crude approximation. And it’s not very hard to understand its limitations" 

- Charlie Munger

"Asking Warren what good books he knows about accounting is like asking him what good books he has on breathing. You start with basic rules of bookkeeping, and then you have to spend a lot of time to really become knowledgeable"

- Charlie Munger

"Certainly, the great short squeeze in GameStop was wretched excess. Certainly,  Bitcoin is wretched excess. I would argue that venture capitalists are throwing too much money too fast. There’s considerable wretched excess in VC & other forms of PE.”

Munger:

“Warren and I do more reading and thinking and less doing than most people in business.”

— Charlie Munger

"Warren adored his father, who was a wonderful man.

But he was a heavy ideologue (right wing, as it happened), who hung around with other very heavy ideologues (right wing, naturally). Warren observed this as a kid.

And he decided that ideology was dangerous—and that he was going to stay a long way from it. And he has throughout his whole life.

That has enormously helped the accuracy of his cognition."

"The best thing a human being can do is to help another human being know more."

Charlie Munger:
"Projections are put together by people who have an interest in a particular outcome, have a subconscious bias, and its apparent precision makes it fallacious. They remind me of Mark Twain's saying, 'A mine is a hole in the ground owned by a liar.'  

- Charlie Munger

"There's going to be some failure in making the correct decisions—nobody bats a thousand."

"I've been associated for many years with a man legendary for good judgement, and it never ceases to amaze me to see how much territory can be grasped if one merely masters and consistently uses all the obvious and easily learned principles."

Charlie on being trustworthy

“Do the best you can do. Never tell a lie. If you say you’re going to do it, get it done. Nobody cares about an excuse.”

"The game is to keep learning."

— Charlie Munger

"Try more to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

— Charlie Munger

Charlie Munger shares the important relationship between new technology and owner's earnings in his famous 1994 speech at USC business school:

"The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it’s going to kill you."

Buddha said, "I only teach one thing. I teach the cause of human sorrow & how to avoid some of it." 
Well, that is my approach to wisdom & learning. If you figure out what doesn't work in investments and in life; then avoid it, you will be way ahead of the crowd.

Charlie Munger: 

You get a lot of dysfunction in a big, fat, powerful [business] where no one will bring unwelcome reality to the boss.

Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition.

"Hard work, honesty, if you keep at it, will get you almost anything."

“Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much–loved hand.”

"Extreme patience combined with extreme decisiveness. You may call that our investment process. Yes, it's that simple."

— Charlie Munger

Another simple effect I very seldom see discussed either by investment managers or anybody else is the effect of taxes.

If you buy something that compounds for 30 years at 15% and you pay one 35% tax at the *very end*, the way that works out is that after taxes, you keep 13.3%.

- Charlie Munger

Charlie on morals

“Always take the high road, it’s far less crowded."

"You need to keep raw irrational emotions under control. You need patience and discipline and an ability to take losses and adversity without going crazy. You also need the ability to not be driven crazy by extreme success."

Investment managers would say, "We have to be that way. That's how we're measured"

They may be right in terms of the way business is now constructed

But from the viewpoint of a rational consumer, the whole svstems "bonkers" & draws talented people into socially useless activity.

One of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simple.

And we've said over and over again that this is not an opinion, but a promise.

In the investment business, people think they can learn a million things and think they will excel in all those million things. That's a joke. That's a delusion. The way to get ahead is to focus and bet big on few. That's what I did.

Notes from Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charlie Munger turned into maxims:

1. Find a simple idea and take it seriously. 

2. Good ideas are rare. When you find one bet heavily. 

3. Humans have been writing down their best ideas for 5,000 years. Read them.

4. Avoiding stupid mistakes is more important than being smart.

5. Don’t work with anyone you don’t admire.

6. Don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy.

7. Avoiding a bad habit is easier than breaking a bad habit.

8. Work on your best idea. Don't diversify

9. Incentives rule everything around you. Look for them. 

10. Great businesses are built by going ridiculously far in maximizing or minimizing one or a few things. Think Costco. 

11. Learning is changing behavior. 

12. Do the unpleasant tasks first.

13. Charlie has read hundreds of biographies. Do the same. 

14. Stop multitasking. Concentrate.
